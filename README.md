# Customer Churn Prediction

A Jupyter Notebook–based customer churn prediction project using raw customer data, feature engineering, model training, and predictions.

---

##  Project Overview

- Why churn matters (e.g., retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones).
- accomplishes: from raw data to model-quality predictions—maybe done via classification algorithms, oversampling, evaluation.
